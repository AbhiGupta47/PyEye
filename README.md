An apparatus that provides users with the ability to surf the web, access their email accounts, write reports, play games and most importantly, communicate through the text-to-speech API using their eye-gaze. This device uses unique powerful computer vision algorithms along with Parse Core to enable the user to personalize and log into their own accounts. The end-result is a Python-based desktop app that interfaces between several different operations such as doing work or just having fun merely with the eyes.

# Current Features
Because iWriter is a platform for games and other productivity applications that can be interfaced with the eyes or the cursor, it is specifically designed for ALS patients who suffer from a poor quality of life. Hence, with this program
patients and users can create their own web-enabled accounts, write notes, play games such as chess, pong, connect4, etc.
and most importantly, communicate by typing on a virtual keyboard (speech-enabled). Users can also send text 
messages to specified numbers but currently, there is no GUI for the messages app yet. Mail is another outlet for expansion
and the program has been designed so that several tiles can be added to the home screen to diversify iWriter and provide 
the user with a better and more productive experience.
